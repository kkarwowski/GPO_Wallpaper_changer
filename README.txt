# This script when run copies a new wallpaper .JPG to 
# C:\Windows\SYSVOL\sysvol\loncc.local\scripts\ which are
# picked up by GPO script upon logging into PC/Laptop.
# It has a sequence built in of 0-7 which is written to
#  Do_not_delete.conf ( text file ).  Here is a sequence:

# Community.JPG - 0
# Family.JPG - 1
# Humility.JPG - 2
# Integrity.JPG - 3
# Learning.jpg - 4
# Mission1.jpg - 5
# Ownership.JPG - 6 
# Respect.JPG - 7
# It is determined by alphabetical order. 
# To schedule for example weekly change of wallpaper set up on AD server in Task Scheduler a new task to call this script every week.
# I have placed a screenshot of Task Scheduler setup in this folder.


# ADDING ADDITIONAL WALLPAPER FILES

# If you want to add files - please change $max_wallpaper_number to desired number of file MINUS 1. For 10 files it means 9. 
# Then copy all the additional .jpg files to $wallpapers_path directory. Make sure they are below 1MB to speed up login for users.

#  DECRESING NUMBER OF WALLPAPER FILES

# If decreeing number of files in the $wallpapers_path directory make sure you check number in do_not_delete.conf and change it accordingly
# so it is not grater than $max_wallpaper_number otherwise script will fail. You can zero out and start sequence from beginning by changing it to 0. 
# Make sure you save the file :)
